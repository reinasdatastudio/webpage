    "text": "This dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. The dataset is used to predict the price of a diamond based on its characteristics such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models to understand the factors that influence diamond prices. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the price of a diamond based on its attributes."

Predictors included: - Treatment group - Age - Gender - Cholesterol level - Number of adverse events\nThe model was fitted using the glm() function with a binomial link. Multicollinearity was assessed using Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) via the car::vif() function.\n\n\nSoftware\nAll analyses were conducted in R (version 4.5.2). Key libraries included tidyverse, ggplot2, rstatix, and car."
